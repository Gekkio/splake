## Modifying Splake
Compiling on the command line is simple, because it's enough to have Maven 3.0.x and Java 1.6+ installed. If you intend to use an IDE, Scala and Project Lombok support are required. If you are a JRebel user, there's a Maven profile called `jrebel` which activates automatic rebel.xml generation.

For example, Eclipse users will need an up-to-date Eclipse installation with m2e, and the following extensions:

+ [Scala IDE for Scala 2.10.x](http://scala-ide.org)
+ [m2eclipse-scala](https://github.com/sonatype/m2eclipse-scala)
+ [Project Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/)
